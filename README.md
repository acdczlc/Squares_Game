Requirements:

- Get Base Game Working
  - Two players can play squares game.
  - The game keeps track of scores, and declares a winner at the end.
  - The game works turn by turn, players get an extra turn for completing a square
  - Improve Look of game
  
  - Written in Python 3, using Pygame and images to display lines of the squares
  - Great example that we will expand upon: https://github.com/NiklasEi/dots-and-boxes-python

- Add local/online leaderboards
  - Local leaderboards could be stored locally, but online leaderboards will need to be stored on a server.
  - Possible online leaderboard source: https://github.com/agoragames/leaderboard-python

- Set up profile
  - Allow users to create an account, possibly add profile pic, and description
  - Can be easily done with firebase
  - Good firebase explanation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users

  - We are still deciding how to implement this
